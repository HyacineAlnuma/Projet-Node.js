# Projet Hot Takes

## CONTEXT

This is my first project using Node.js and noSQL via MongoDB. I made only the backend part of it.
This project was about building an API for "Hot Takes", which is a website that references hot sauces, and allow users to add, modify, delete, like and dislike different sauces.

## INSTALLATION

### .env file

Create a .env file in the backend directory in order to create the following environment variable needed to create the connection to MongoDB:
    `MONGODB_CONNECT`

### `npm install`

Run this command in the root, backend and frontend directory in order to install all the packages needed to run the app.

## RUN THE APP

### Backend:

In the backend directory, you can run:
#### `node server`

Runs the app in the development mode.\

### Frontend:

In the frontend directory, you can run:
#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:4200) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
